    <h3>1.About Adenoviruses</h3>
    <p class="p-content p-content-sm">Biological weapons have been in use for a long time in history, at least thousands of years ago.Adenoviruses are common viruses that cause a range of illness. They can cause cold-like symptoms, fever, sore throat, bronchitis, pneumonia, diarrhea, and pink eye (conjunctivitis). You can get an adenovirus infection at any age. People with weakened immune systems or existing respiratory or cardiac disease are more likely than others to get very sick from an adenovirus infection…</p>


    <h3>2.Symptoms</h3>
      <p class="p-content p-content-sm"><strong>Adenoviruses can cause a wide range of illnesses such as</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li class="p-content p-content-sm">common cold or flu-like symptoms</li>
        <li class="p-content p-content-sm">fever</li>
        <li class="p-content p-content-sm">sore throat</li>
        <li class="p-content p-content-sm">acute bronchitis (inflammation of the airways of the lungs, sometimes called a “chest cold”)</li>
        <li class="p-content p-content-sm">pneumonia (infection of the lungs)</li>
        <li class="p-content p-content-sm">pink eye (conjunctivitis)</li>
        <li class="p-content p-content-sm">acute gastroenteritis</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="p-content p-content-sm">Adenoviruses can cause mild to severe illness, though serious illness is less common. People with weakened immune systems, or existing respiratory or cardiac disease, are at higher risk of developing severe illness from an adenovirus infection.</p>

    <h3>3.Transmission</h3>
    <p class="p-content p-content-sm">Adenoviruses are usually spread from an infected person to others through</p>
    <ul>
        <li class="p-content p-content-sm">close personal contact, such as touching or shaking hands</li>
        <li class="p-content p-content-sm">the air by coughing and sneezing</li>
        <li class="p-content p-content-sm">touching an object or surface with adenoviruses on it, then touching your mouth, nose, or eyes before washing your hands</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="p-content p-content-sm">Sometimes the virus can be shed (released from the body) for a long time after a person recovers from an adenovirus infection, especially among people who have weakened immune systems. This “virus shedding” usually occurs without any symptoms, even though the person can still spread adenovirus to other people.</p>
