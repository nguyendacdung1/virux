    <h3>1.About Australian</h3>
    <p class="p-content p-content-sm">Australian bat lyssavirus (ABLV) is a virus that infects Australian flying foxes (fruit bats) and microbats. The virus can be transmitted from bats to humans and horses, and potentially from bats to other animals, causing fatal encephalitis (inflammation of the brain). Bats infected with ABLV may show neurological signs such as paralysis, weakness, tremors, seizures and abnormal behaviour.</p>

    <h3>2.What is Australian bat lyssavirus (ABLV)?</h3>
    <p class="p-content p-content-sm">ABLV is a virus that is closely related, but different, to classical rabies virus. The genus Lyssavirus (‘lyssa’ meaning rage) has 14 different genotypes, which includes rabies virus and ABLV. Each of these viruses is capable of causing rabies-like disease in animals and humans. Classical rabies virus is not present in Australia.</p>
    <p class="p-content p-content-sm">ABLV was first detected in Australia in a black flying fox in 1996. Since then the virus has been isolated in bats in New South Wales, the Northern Territory, Queensland, Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia.</p>
    <p class="p-content p-content-sm">ABLV infection has been found in the four common species of flying foxes (Pteropus sp.), in one blossom bat (Syconycteris australis) and in one microbat, an insectivorous yellow-bellied sheathtail bat (Saccolaimus flaviventris). It appears that bats are the only reservoir host for ABLV.</p>
    <p class="p-content p-content-sm">While 2004 research indicates that ABLV is present in less than 1% of free-living bats, ABLV is more likely to be detected in sick, injured or orphaned bats. However, some infected bats do not show any signs of ill-health so it should be assumed that all bats are potential hosts of ABLV.</p>

    <h3>3.How is Australian bat lyssavirus transmitted?</h3>
    <p class="p-content p-content-sm">ABLV can be transmitted by bites and scratches from infected bats. There is also potential for transmission by absorbing infected bat saliva through the eyes, nose and mouth.</p>
    <p class="p-content p-content-sm">The virus is unlikely to survive outside the bat for more than a few hours. There is no known risk of contracting ABLV from bats flying overhead. Viable Australian bat lyssavirus has not been found in bat faeces or urine.</p>
    <h3>4.Signs of infection in bats</h3>
    <p class="p-content p-content-sm">The disease signs that may indicate that a bat has ABLV infection are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li class="p-content p-content-sm">abnormal behaviour</li>
        <li class="p-content p-content-sm">excitation, agitation and aggression</li>
        <li class="p-content p-content-sm">paralysis</li>
        <li class="p-content p-content-sm">unusual vocalisation</li>
        <li class="p-content p-content-sm">fighting with other bats</li>
        <li class="p-content p-content-sm">inability to fly</li>
        <li class="p-content p-content-sm">loss of body condition</li>
        <li class="p-content p-content-sm">convulsions/seizures/tremors.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="p-content p-content-sm">Note that apparently healthy bats with normal behaviours may still be infected with ABLV.</p>
