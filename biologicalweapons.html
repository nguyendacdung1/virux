    <h3>1.Biological weapons and history</h3>
    <p class="p-content p-content-sm">A biological weapon is a weapon of mass destruction based on the pathogenic or disease-transmitting properties of microorganisms such as germs and bacteria; or toxins secreted by some germs to cause pathogens or death to humans, animals or crops, destroy crops, pollute the ecological environment. This leads to unpredictable consequences, depending on their ability to spread in the body of an animal or plant.</p>
    <p class="p-content p-content-sm">Biological weapons have been in use for a long time in history, at least thousands of years ago.</p>
    <p class="p-content p-content-sm">In ancient times, it was known to use pathogens that were toxic to the enemy. Throwing the corpses of infected people into the enemy's ramparts is a measure of wear and tearing down enemy vitality. Around the 6th century BC, it was known to use mushrooms with hallucinogenic substances with enemies. In 184 BC, jars with poisonous snakes were thrown into enemy boats.</p>
    <p class="p-content p-content-sm">In the Middle Ages, victims of the plague were used as biological weapons to attack the enemy by throwing these corpses into enemy walls. In 1346, the bodies of soldiers who had died of the plague were thrown over the walls of kaffa by the Mongols to infect the defenders. These are the things that set the stage for the creation of the Black Death pandemic in Europe.</p>
    <p class="p-content p-content-sm">In 1940-1941, japanese troops sprayed in 11 Chinese provinces with bombs containing microorganisms that caused the plague. They also released plague-infected lice, grains of rice infected with the plague to attract rats to eat, then spread the disease everywhere in China.</p>
    <p class="p-content p-content-sm">In 1950-1953, during the Korean War, the U.S. used biological weapons by releasing insects that sickened people and rice in north Korean military-controlled areas.</p>


    <h3>2.Viruses and biological weapons</h3>

    <p class="p-content p-content-sm">The virus' ability to create epidemics in human society has led to concerns that the virus could be weaponized for biological warfare.</p>
    <p class="p-content p-content-sm">This anxiety was heightened by the successful reproduction of the famous 1918 Spanish flu virus in a laboratory.  The smallpox virus also devastated many societies throughout human history before it was completely eradicated. There are only two official centers that host smallpox viruses – russia's Vector Laboratory and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control.</p>
    <p class="p-content p-content-sm">However, the fear that it could be used as a weapon is not necessarily unfounded; Smallpox vaccines sometimes have serious side effects – in the last years before smallpox was eradicated, more people became seriously ill as a result of vaccination than were directly infected. Smallpox vaccination has also ceased to be widely adopted, and as such, the majority of the modern human population has almost no established resistance against smallpox.</p>
