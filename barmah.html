    <h3>1.About barmah</h3>
    <p class="p-content p-content-sm">Barmah Forest Virus. Barmah Forest virus is the name given to a virus that is carried by mosquitoes. The mosquito may have contracted the virus from infected marsupials particularly possums, kangaroos and wallabies or from infected humans. The infection is not fatal and all people who develop the disease do recover.</p>

    <h3>2.Where does Barmah disease come from?</h3>
    <p class="p-content p-content-sm">This disease was named after the Barmah Forest in the northern Victoria region of Australia where it was first isolated in 1974. The first documented case in humans was in 1986. As of 2015, it has been found only in Australia.
    </p>
    <p class="p-content p-content-sm">Reduce the chance of being bitten by mosquitoes by wearing long, loose-fitting clothes and using effective insect repellents in mosquito-prone areas. Barmah Forest virus (BFV) disease can cause joint inflammation and pain, fatigue and a rash of variable appearance.</p>


    <h3>3.Prevention: </h3>
    <p class="p-content p-content-sm">The best prevention is to take precautions against being bitten by mosquitos:</p>
    <ul>
        <li class="p-content p-content-sm">use insect repellents and wear protective, light coloured clothing</li>
        <li class="p-content p-content-sm">avoid being outside during times of heavy infestation of mosquitoes, eg. early evenings in the warmer months</li>
        <li class="p-content p-content-sm">screen living and sleeping areas</li>
        <li class="p-content p-content-sm">check your home regularly for potential mosquito breeding areas, eg. any uncovered water containers, small wading pools and old tyres should be emptied regularly.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="p-content p-content-sm">Mosquito eradication programs are the most effective way to control spread of disease. Health officers from most local councils and state health departments work together to develop and implement mosquito eradication programs.</p>
