    <h3>1.About Aichiviruses</h3>
    <p class="p-content-sm p-content">The Aichivirus A formerly Aichi virus (AiV) is a small, round, cytopathic positive sense and ssRNA virus. Originally identified after a 1989 outbreak of acute gastroenteritis in the Aichi Prefecture, probably linked to raw oyster, genetic analysis has classified it as belonging to the family Picornaviridae, genus Kobuvirus.

        It has since been isolated in studies of Finnish children, Pakistani children, and Japanese travelers.</p>
    <p class="p-content p-content-sm">The Aichi Virus is a member of the Kobuvirus genus in the Picornaviridae family. It is a positive sense, single-stranded RNA virus. The Aichi Virus appears to morphologically resemble astroviruses when examined by electron microscopy. The virus was first isolated from an individual with a non-bacterial oyster associated gastroenteritis. The virus is a known cause of gastroenteritis in humans. It is the only virus in the Kobuvirus genus that has been found in humans</p>

    <h3>2.Genome Structure</h3>
    <p class="p-content p-content-sm">The Aichi Virus is a positive sense single stranded RNA virus with a genome of 8,280 nt and a poly (A) tail, which helps with the stability and decreases degradation of the RNA molecule. It has a 59% G+C content, which is very high for Picornaviridae. It has a large opening reading frame at 7,302 nt, that translates for a potential polyprotein precursor of 2,433 amino acids. The virus also can be divided into 2 genotypes, A and B, with around 90% sequence homology. The stem-loop at the 5' end of the Aichi Virus genome has been found to be an element involved in both viral RNA replication and production of infectious virus particles.</p>

    <h3>3.Viral Ecology & Pathology</h3>
    <p class="p-content p-content-sm">There is not much known about the epidemiology as of May 2013. However, the Aichi Virus was first isolated from a case of an oyster related non-bacterial gastroenteritis in Japan. This was the first isolation, but the virus was soon isolated in Japanese travelers in Southeast Asia, fecal specimens of children with diarrhea in several countries like: Brazil, France, Germany, and Tunisia. An infection caused by the Aichi Virus can result in Gastroenteritis (the stomach flu). The virus is found to be mostly food borne. Symptoms include nausea and vomiting among others. No information on virulence factors were found as of May 2013.</p>
